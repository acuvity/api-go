If you set this to Transparent, then the Apex will record traces within Acuvity as they are being passed by the application in the respective traceparent HTTP header or other OpenInference related trace context transport methods. Note that with the Transparent mode, you might lose some spans that belong to a trace as the Apex can sit before your application itself. If you want to ensure you capture the full trace, you need to set this value to Recording. When the Apex is acting in Recording mode, it will record its own interactions as spans of its own. This ensures that all spans for a trace are captured. However, if you rely on complete tracing data in your own tracing system, then you should configure the otelExporter to ensure that the Apex is exporting its spans to your tracing system. Additionally, for both Transparent and Recording modes, you should ensure that the application is reporting its spans to Acuvity as well. This can be realized by running OTLP receivers within your application components by configuring the otelReceivers setting.",
